After initializing
[50,free]

After the first malloc
[10,allocated]->[40,free]

After the second malloc
[10,allocated]->[20,allocated]->[20,free]

Asking for an un-allocatable block
Good. The call to malloc returned NULL

Free the second block
[10,free]->[20,allocated]->[20,free]

Allocate a block too big for the initial open block
[10,free]->[20,allocated]->[15,allocated]->[5,free]

Free the most recently allocated pointer
[10,free]->[20,allocated]->[20,free]

Free the middle block
[50,free]
